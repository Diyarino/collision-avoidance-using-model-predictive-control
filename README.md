# Collision Avoidance for Drones in 3D using Model Predictive Control (MPC)

This repository provides an implementation of a **Model Predictive Control (MPC)** framework for real-time **collision avoidance** in a 3D environment for multiple drones. It ensures safe navigation while achieving trajectory tracking objectives.

- 3D drone dynamics modeling
- Real-time trajectory tracking
- Predictive collision avoidance for multiple UAVs
- Configurable constraints (velocity, acceleration, safety distance)
- Modular and simulation-ready design

## üß† Algorithm Summary

This system uses MPC to:
- Predict future states of each drone over a finite time horizon.
- Optimize control inputs to minimize deviation from a desired trajectory.
- Introduce soft or hard constraints to avoid inter-drone collisions.
- Solve a constrained optimization problem at each time step.


## üì¶ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

* **Python** ‚â• 3.6
* **PyTorch** ‚â• 1.0 (CUDA support recommended for faster training)
* **matplotlib, numpy, scipy**

We also recommend using a virtual environment (e.g., `venv` or `conda`) to avoid package conflicts.

## üöÄ Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/collision-avoidance-mpc.git
cd collision-avoidance-mpc
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
